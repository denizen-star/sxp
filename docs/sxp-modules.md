# SXP Modules Architecture

## 🏗️ Module Overview

SXP is built on a modular architecture with six core modules that work together to create a comprehensive professional networking platform.

## 📋 Module Specifications

### **1. Authentication Module** ✅ COMPLETE

### **2. User & Persona Management Module** 🔄 IN DEVELOPMENT

**Purpose:** The data source for SXP's matching system

**Key Functions:**
- **User Profile CRUD:** Handling creation, reading, updating, and deletion of all user professional data (goals, skills, history, preferences)
- **Data Ingestion APIs:** Secure endpoints for ingesting data (e.g., from LinkedIn, sign-up questionnaires, etc.)
- **Persona Indexing Service:** The core logic that processes raw data into the structured, weighted features used for matching

**Technical Focus:**
- Secure data storage
- Compliance (privacy/PII)
- Robust data validation pipelines
- ML-based persona assignment

**Status:** 🔄 Development in progress

---

### **3. Matching & Recommendation Engine** 📋 PLANNED

**Purpose:** The brain of SXP, where the social experiment is run and value is generated

**Key Functions:**
- **Matching Algorithm:** Executes clustering, graph analysis, or other ML models to calculate the **Mutual Benefit Score** between pairs or groups of users
- **Curation Service:** Accepts a **Context** (e.g., "Seed Funding Event," "Engineering Collaboration") and returns an **Optimized Group/Pairing** to maximize predicted success
- **Real-Time API:** Provides low-latency matching recommendations for on-the-fly co-working space assignments or sudden meeting opportunities

**Technical Focus:**
- Machine Learning (ML) Ops
- High-performance computing (for complex graph traversal/optimization)
- Continuous model re-training
- Real-time recommendation systems

**Status:** 📋 Planning phase

---

### **4. Event & Space Management Module** 📋 PLANNED

**Purpose:** Handles the physical and virtual logistics required to execute curated matches

**Key Functions:**
- **Event Creation/Scheduling:** Tools for organizers to define event parameters (date, location, goal, capacity)
- **Assignment & Booking:** Taking the output of the Matching Engine and applying it to physical resources (e.g., assigning User A to Desk 3, or inviting Group B to Meeting Room 5)
- **Notification/Communication Bridge:** Sending structured data to the User-Facing Module for alerts, calendar invites, and welcome messages

**Technical Focus:**
- Integration with external calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Room booking APIs
- Geo-location services (for proximity-based events)
- Real-time communication systems

**Status:** 📋 Planning phase

---

### **5. Engagement Tracking & Analytics Module** 📋 PLANNED

**Purpose:** Captures the results of the "social experiment" to measure success and fuel the next iteration of the ML model

**Key Functions:**
- **Interaction Data Ingestion:** APIs for capturing feedback (e.g., user ratings of a connection, meeting longevity, follow-up actions)
- **Data Warehouse/Lake:** A structured store for all historical engagement data (the "ground truth")
- **Metrics & Reporting:** Generating key performance indicators (KPIs) for both users (e.g., "Relationships Forged") and organizers (e.g., "Network Efficacy Score")
- **ML Feedback Pipeline:** A service that continuously extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) the engagement data back to the Matching Engine for re-training

**Technical Focus:**
- Event-driven architecture (using a message queue like Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- Asynchronous ingestion of high volumes of tracking data
- Robust reporting/BI tools
- Data pipeline optimization

**Status:** 📋 Planning phase

---

### **6. API Gateway & Security Module** 📋 PLANNED

**Purpose:** The single entry point for all client requests, ensuring security and proper routing

**Key Functions:**
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Managing user login, tokens, and permissions (who can read whose profile data, who can view event logs)
- **Request Routing:** Directing client requests to the correct backend service (e.g., /user/profile goes to Module 1, /events/curate goes to Module 2)
- **Rate Limiting/DDoS Protection:** Ensuring the platform remains stable under load

**Technical Focus:**
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect implementation
- Firewall/WAF configuration
- Unified logging
- Security monitoring

**Status:** 📋 Planning phase

---

### **7. User-Facing Module (The Client)** ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Purpose:** The applications users interact with (web and future mobile)

**Key Functions:**
- **Dynamic UI Rendering:** Displaying personalized profiles and curated event/seating assignments from the backend services
- **Communication Layer:** In-app messaging or chat functionality to facilitate connections
- **User Input Interface:** The forms and workflows for gathering the critical persona data
- **Location Services:** (If required) Managing user check-in/presence for co-working spaces

**Technical Focus:**
- React-based web application
- Mobile development (iOS/Android) - future
- Seamless, personalized user experience
- Real-time updates

**Status:** ✅ Core components ready, 🔄 Mobile development planned
